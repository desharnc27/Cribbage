The input must have 7 strings seperated by commas, no space.
The first string indicates who has the crib, the 6 others represent the 6 cards of your hand.
The first string must be 'y' or 'n' (yes if you have the crib, no otherwise)
For any string representing a card, the first character must be 's', 'c', 'd' or 'h', indicating if the suit of the card (spade, club, diamond, heart)
For any string representing a card, the last character must be 'A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q' or 'K', indicating the number of the card.
Examples of argument: "y,s5,d6,s3,dQ,h4,cK" or "n,d8,s8,c6,c7,d5,cT"

Note: there are some shorten ways of writting the input faster
- Ace may also be entered as "1"
- uppercase/lowercase does not matter for card numbers
- Not indicating any suit will make the program assign suits for the cards. There will be 1 or 2 cards for each suit.
- Indicating the suit of at least 2 cards but not all of them will make the program assign a same unused suit for all other cards.

Examples:

- "y,1,2,3,9,t,j" is the same as "y,sA,c2,d3,h9,sT,cJ"
- "n,c3,s2,2,4,5,h5" is the same as "n,c3,s2,d2,d4,d5,h5"
